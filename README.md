# Recipe-Radar
RecipeRadar is a React.js-based recipe discovery platform. It allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients they have at hand or dietary preferences. The app fetches data from various recipe APIs, displays detailed recipes with images and cooking instructions, and even suggests substitutions for certain ingredients.
